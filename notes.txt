I should look into Bokeh, Plotly, etc. to be able to use it with python inorder to use it in a more portable way.

I can have a simple javascript version also, with bunch of textboxes to enter information:
-Data
-Axis
-Range
etc.
But this doesn't sound the way it should be done.

3rd option is to do it in R/Shiny.


I will look into these technologies next.
